The class taught me how to effectively create soundscapes, editing, and sounds in general to effectively convey ideas and emotions. For my final project, I created a short podcast called “Beep Boop” that tackled the question “What is a computer?” in a comedic way. This was an opportunity for me to create a podcast that merged my passion for tech and digital content creation together.",
