        Description: "During my third year (Spring 2020), I took a classed called CA 449: Sound Cultures and Podcasting. The class taught me how to effectively create soundscapes, editing, and sounds in general to effectively convey ideas and emotions. For my final project, I created a short podcast called “Beep Boop” that tackled the question “What is a computer?” in a comedic way. This was an opportunity for me to create a podcast that merged my passion for tech, digital content creation, and humor.",
