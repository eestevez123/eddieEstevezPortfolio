The first organization presented was Inroads, founded in Chicago by Frank C Carr in 1970, whose goal was to help young adults from diverse communities get connected with decisionmakers within companies, and then allow them direct access to apply and get internship/full-time positions that best suit them and their professional interests.

My team elected to focus on Apprisen, who wanted not only a redesigned website, but a way to improve retention of clients and ensure they stay on track of their debt payments. The challenge then was making sure to have a robust user experience so that the user could feel motivated to keep on achieving their financial goals, as well as make sure that the user has easy access on their progress and program information.
