        WhatIDid: "I worked with 2 other interns within the team to collect datapoints from many different models to track how assets change and interact with each other every single day. I started with importing and scraping CSV files, cleaning the data to make sure I can run further calculations, such as the means and averages between asset classes and more. For this, I used a python script with the help of packages such as numpy, pytorch, and pandas. This python script would run every day with the help of Jenkins that would ultimately produce a final CSV file that I pointed to with a Tableau dashboard I designed. This Tableau dashboard was an interactive and visual way of seeing key performing information on the assets within the models I was working with. ",
