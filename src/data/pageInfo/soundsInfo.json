    "Description": "In my third year (Spring 2020), I enrolled in CA 449: Sound Cultures and Podcasting. This course provided me with valuable skills in crafting soundscapes, editing, and utilizing sound to convey ideas and emotions effectively. For my final project, I produced a humorous podcast titled \"Beep Boop,\" which explored the question \"What is a computer?\" This project allowed me to merge my interests in technology, digital content creation, and comedy into a single creative endeavor."
